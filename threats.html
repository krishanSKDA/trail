Equipped with unique body armor to cover them from their natural adversaries, they've swum the swell since dinosaurs floated the land. still, in recent history, fleetly adding mortal populations have redounded in new and acute pressures, making ocean turtle survival ever more delicate.</p>
            <p> Expert members of the IUCN- SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group have linked five major pitfalls to ocean turtles worldwide fisheries bycatch, littoral development, pollution and pathogens, direct take, and climate change.</p>

                    <h3>Habitat loss and degradation</h3> 
                    <p> Sea turtles are facing the  trouble of  niche loss due to  colorful  mortal conditioning that have destroyed their nesting  strands around the world. The major causes of  niche loss are  unbridled  littoral development, vehicle business on  strands, and other  mortal conditioning. Coastal armoring,  similar as  ocean walls,  gemstone revetments, and other man- made structures, can negatively affect  littoral ecosystems and wildlife by  snooping with natural  sand shaping forces and disturbing  niche, especially  ocean turtle nesting. </p></td>
               
                <td><img src="./Threats/img2thr02.jpg"> 
                    <h3>Climate change</h3>
                    <p>Climate change is having a significant impact on sea turtles, not only leading to smaller turtles being born but also causing gender imbalances in the incubation temperature of eggs. As warmer ocean temperatures cause more female than male hatchlings, this poses a significant threat to genetic diversity. Furthermore, rising ocean levels can lead to cataracts and dwindling successful nesting rates. The loss of nesting beaches from increased erosion and beach loss in some areas directly affects sea turtle nesting habitats, as shown by washed-out nests in Florida,</p>

                      <h3>Disease and parasites</h3>
                     <p>Sea turtles are susceptible to various diseases and parasites that can affect their health and survival. Some common diseases in sea turtles include fibropapillomatosis, which is a tumor-forming disease caused by a herpesvirus, and bacterial or fungal infections. Parasites such as blood flukes, leeches, and nematodes can also affect sea turtles, causing internal and external damage to their bodies . These diseases and parasites can weaken the turtles' immune systems, making them more vulnerable to other threats in their environment.</p></td>
                <td><img src="Threats/img4thr04.webp"> 
                    <h3>Light pollution</h3> 
                     <p>Light pollution can have a significant impact on sea turtle hatchlings, as it disrupts the natural light cues they use for dispersal. Lights along the coast can cause hatchlings to travel landward instead of seaward, or they can be attracted to lights on boats or jetties, which can cause them to perish from exhaustion or predation . Unfiltered lights in coastal areas can disorient hatchlings and deter adult turtles from nesting in the first place. It is important to avoid light pollution in coastal areas to help protect sea turtles .</p></td>
                <td><img src="Threats/img5thr05.jpg"> 
                     <h3>Bycatch in fishing gear</h3>
                     <p>Turtle bycatch is a major threat to sea turtles, with hundreds of thousands accidentally caught by gillnets, shrimp trawl nets, and longline hooks each year. To reduce bycatch, the Southeast US has developed turtle excluder devices (TEDs) and fishing lights, such as LED or chemical lightsticks, which can be attached to nets to create enough of a warning to alert marine turtles to a barrier. Testing has shown encouraging results, with a reduction in the number of turtles caught in these illuminated nets compared to those without lights. </p></td>
                <td><img src="Threats/img6thr06.webp"> 
                     <h3>Plastic Ingestion</h3> 
                    <p>Plastic ingestion poses a significant threat to sea turtles, as they can mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and ingest them. This can cause blockages in their intestines and even pierce the intestinal wall, leading to internal bleeding. Research has shown that even one piece of plastic can cause a sea turtle to perish, with the odds of mortality for a sole segment of plastic being ingested placed at 22%. Plastic pollution is so deadly that it kills thousands of marine turtles each year, making plastic ingestion a greater threat to sea turtles' survival than oil spills. </p></td>

        <h2>Solutions 01</h2>
        <h3>Reduce, reuse, and recycle your plastics.</h3>
        <p>The most important details in this text are the three key actions that can help save sea turtles: reducing plastic use, reusing plastics whenever possible, and recycling them appropriately. To help save sea turtles, it is important to reduce plastic consumption altogether, opt for disposable items made from wood, bamboo, paper, or other biodegradable materials, and embrace glass containers instead of plastic storage options. plastic use is unavoidable, it is important to prioritize recycling, as it contributes to the circular economy and helps reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean. Every small action counts, and by reducing, reusing, and recycling plastics, we can help protect sea turtles and preserve our oceans for future generations.</p>

        <h2>Solutions 02</h2>
        <h3>Turn off your lights.</h3>
        <p>If you live near a beach or are fortunate enough to enjoy a beach vacation, it is important to consider the presence of sea turtles and their nesting habits. To support their breeding success and the survival of their hatchlings, take the following steps: ascertain if sea turtles nest on your beach by contacting local conservation organizations or beach authorities, turn off any lights that are visible from the beach at night, and minimize light pollution.Each action taken to protect sea turtles can make a significant difference in their survival, as only a few hatchlings out of thousands reach adulthood. Close your curtains, switch off lights, and embrace the beauty of a dark beach, allowing sea turtles to thrive undisturbed.

        <h2>Solutions 03</h2>
        <h3> Do not buy anything made from sea turtles.</h3>
        <p>The trade of turtle shell products poses a significant threat to the survival of sea turtles. To make it easier, it is best to refrain from purchasing anything that resembles turtle shell. This will help to discourage the demand for turtle shell items and contribute to the conservation of sea turtles. By making conscious choices as consumers, we can help combat the trade in turtle shell and promote a sustainable and responsible approach to tourism.

        <h2>Solutions 04</h2>
        <h3>Collect loose fishing line and recycle it.</h3>
        <p>When engaging in fishing activities or encountering fishing line on the beach, it is crucial to take action and collect the discarded line, ensuring its proper recycling. Sea turtles are unable to detect discarded fishing line, and if they become entangled in it, they can suffer injuries or even lose their lives as a result.This serves as a powerful motivation to proactively pick up trash whenever you visit the beach. By keeping a bag handy and taking the initiative to collect a few items, you actively contribute to the protection of sea turtles, helping to prevent them from experiencing harm. Your efforts play a vital role in preserving the well-being of these magnificent creatures, ensuring a safer and cleaner environment for them to thrive.

        <h2>Solutions 05</h2>
        <h3>Avoid Products Containing Microbeads</h3>
        <p>In recent years, the proliferation of microbeads has contributed significantly to the problem of ocean plastic pollution. These minuscule plastic particles are commonly present in certain facial scrubs, toothpastes, and body washes. Unfortunately, they easily find their way into our oceans and waterways through sewer systems, posing a threat to numerous marine species. combat this issue, it is important to steer clear of products that contain plastic microbeads. When checking the ingredient labels of cosmetic products, watch out for terms like "polyethylene" and "polypropylene," as they indicate the presence of these harmful microplastics. By actively avoiding such products, you contribute to the protection of marine life and help reduce the impact of microbeads on our precious oceans.
