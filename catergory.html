        <p>On earth there is a categorization of the 343 turtle species based on their habitat resulting in division into three main groups including land-turtles, aquatic-turtles, and sea-turtle group, while belonging in a single chelonian familial group, turtles have managed to adapt with distinct morphological traits and survive diverse habitats. The issue of endangered turtles has become more pressing due to the declining numbers of species in places like French Polynesia</p>
        <ul style type="circle"><strong> Following facts will help you.</strong>
            <li>
                Longevity is one advantage enjoyed by land turtle species over their sea and aquatic cousins and the turtle longevity record is held by giant turtles like those found in the Seychelles and Galapagos Islands who can live up to 150 years.</li>
            <li>When faced with danger or threats from predators, turtles have the ability to retract both their legs and heads inside their shells, so a thick and curved shell ensures protection against predator attacks.</li>
            <li>The limbs of aquatic turtles feature webs and the shape of a turtle's shell can vary depending on whether it lives mostly in water or on land.</li>
            <li>
                A light and sleek shell characterizes the sea turtle, and the properties of this object enable it to slide more efficiently when submerged.
                </li>
            <li>Sea turtles come back to shore exclusively for nesting purposes.</li>
            <li>The Polynesian sea turtle is just one of many endangered species at present.</li>

        <p>The verdant turtle distinguishes itself as both one of the largest sea creatures and also as a sole representative within its nonidentical species, and the coloration and overlapping nature of green turtle's bones is where they derive their name from rather than simply basing it on shell appearance.<br>The name 'black turtle' is what local inhabitants call verdant turtles in the Eastern Pacific that have darker shells, and green turtles tend to inhabit predominantly warm water regions such as the tropics.Like many other marine turtles, these animals will swim hundreds of miles each year from nesting sites to foraging waters, but the survival chances for verdant turtles are shrinking due to multiple threats such as hunting both younglings & mature specimens along with egg over-collection & habitat degradation.

         <p>The powerful jaw muscles of Loggerhead turtles supports their large head that named them. Clams and sea urchins are among the hard-shelled prey that they can crush. Their meat or shell is less sought after compared to other sea turtles. Accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear or bycatch is a damaging issue for loggerhead turtles.<br> Hence, their frequent interaction with fisheries.

            Nesting on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya, Loggerheads are known to be the most common turtles in the Mediterranean. Their nesting beaches face a threat from tourism development. During the past 100 million years, sea turtles travelled our seas as representatives of a group of reptiles. Maintaining the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds relies heavily on their fundamental role in marine ecosystems

The only known nesting areas for loggerheads in the North Pacific are set up in southern Japan.<br> &nbsp; Nesting occurs in the western skirtings of the Atlantic and Indian abysses, primarily in Oman, the United States, and Australia. Adult loggerheads are known to make expansive migrations between rustling areas and nesting strands, and during non-nesting times, adult ladies from U.S. strands are distributed in waters off the eastern U.S. and throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Yucatán. Coral reefs, rocky places, and boat smashups draw large quantities of marine life and are great feeding areas.</li>

         <p>Kemp's ridley ocean turtles are considered the lowest marine turtles in the world and are also the most exposed. The Kemp's ridley has a triangular-structured head and a hardly hooked beak with voluminous crushing shells. Grown-ups have a closely indirect carapace( top pod) that’s gray verdant, while the plastron( bottom pod) is pale unheroic to cream in color. Hatchlings are black on both sides. The carapace is frequently as wide as it's long and contains five dyads of costal scutes. Each of the frontal flippers has one claw, while the reverse flippers may have one or two. On moderate, grown-ups weigh around 100 pounds( 45 kilograms) with a carapace( top pod) measuring between 24 to 28 elevation( 60 to 70 centimeters) in extent.

This nesting population endured a ruinous decline between the late 1940s and themid-1980s.<br> The number of nests reached a record low of 702 in 1985, representing smaller than 250 nesting ladies. Due to ferocious conservation conduct, the Kemp's ridley began to sluggishly rebound during the 1990s.<br> The number of nests increased about 15 percent each time through 2009. still, in 2010 this rapid-fire increase suddenly ended and the number of nests has changed since also. The maturity of Kemp’s ridley nesting occurs on the strands of the western Gulf of Mexico and ninety- five percent of worldwide Kemp’s ridley nesting occurs in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. <br>The three main nesting strands in Tamaulipas are Rancho Nuevo, Tepehuajes, and Barra del Tordo. Nesting also occurs in Veracruz, Mexico, and in Texas, but on a much lower scale. Occasional nesting has been proved in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</li>

         <p>The name for this ocean turtle is tied to the color of its shell an olive green tinge. They're presently the most abundant of all ocean turtles.<br> Their vulnerable status comes from the fact that they nest in a veritably small number of places, and thus any disturbance to indeed one nest sand could have huge impacts on the entire population.
